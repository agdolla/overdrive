'@autoguru/overdrive': major
---

Styles are now `treat` driven.

## A few changes

- `OverdriveProvider` must now be provider
- `ToastProvider` must also be provided when using a `useToast`
- `@autoguru/overdrive/reset` must be given first.

... and a whole series of other things. Please consult to the PR (#273) to get a better idea of what's changed.
